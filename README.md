# quaternion
A Python extension to provide a Quaternion type and some associated functions.

This was initally more an experiment to create a Python extension written in C
that was a bit more challenging that "hello world".

Altough there are already a number of Quaternion Python packages out there, this
has the advantage of speed over the pure Python implementations aand no dependencies
such as numpy
